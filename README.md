Shooting-Algorithm
==================
I have written a function that solves the LASSO problem. The method is called the shooting algorithm and it is an example of coordinate descent. Moreover, I have written a script (regPathDemo.m) which shows how the variables drop out from the regresson problem as the smoothing parameter increases, i.e sparsity as a result of LASSO.
